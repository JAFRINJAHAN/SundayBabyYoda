/* 4. The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique used by Julius Caesar to securely communicate 
   with his generals. Each letter is replaced by another letter N positions down the english alphabet.
   For example, for a rotation of 5, the letter 'c' would be replaced by an 'h'. 
   In case of a 'z', the alphabet rotates and it is transformed into a 'd'.
   Implement a decoder for the Caesar cipher where N = 5.
   TIP: Use code.toCharArray() to get an array of characters.*/
